"""
Deterministic Evidence Verifier

Verifies that Evidence objects genuinely correspond to the structured
transcript and that claims have textual support from their cited evidence.

This is a deterministic baseline verifier using lexical overlap only.
It does NOT understand semantics, negation, uncertainty, temporal changes,
or contradiction. Those limitations will be addressed in a future
LLM-assisted verification stage.

Uses Python standard-library only — no external dependencies.
